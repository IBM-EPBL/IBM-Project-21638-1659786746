Data Collection

Data pre-processing is a process of cleaning the raw data i.e. the data is collected in the real world and is converted to a clean data set. In other words, whenever the data is gathered from different sources it is collected in a raw format and this data isn’t feasible for the analysis.
Therefore, certain steps are executed to convert the data into a small clean data set, this part of the process is called as data pre-processing Follow the following steps to process your Data

•	Import the Libraries

•	Importing the dataset

•	Taking care of Missing Data

•	Label encoding

•	One Hot Encoding

•	Feature Scaling

•	Splitting Data into Train and Test
